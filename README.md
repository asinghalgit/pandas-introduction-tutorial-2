We will be using gapminder data set for following queries

1. How to drop a particular column and set of columns from a data frame
2. What is the role of attribute named "inplace" in a data frame?
3. how to apply group by clause on a particular column or a set of columns in a data frame and then calculate mean on another column 
4. how to apply group by clause on a particular column or a set of columns in a data frame and then perform different aggregate functions on another column
5. can we use underscore while mentioning a big number say 10 million i.e. 10_000_000
6. Trailing comma in a list i.e. [1,2,3,]

We will be using table1 data set for following questions
7. how to read csv file 

We will be using table2 data set for following questions
8. clean table2 data set using pivot

We will be using table3 data set for following questions
9. split rate column and add new columns in table3 data frame

We will be talking about functions in python now:
10. define a function names my_function that does nothing and accepts x and y as arguments
11. define a function names square that accepts one argument and returns square of it.
12. example how to use assert
13. example of how to manually create a data frame using pandas
14. example of how to apply a function to each element of column
15. example of how to apply a function to complete column 
16. define a function which takes one complete column as input argument and returns mean of that column values using np.mean
17. define a function which takes one complete column as input argument and returns mean of that column values without using np.mean
18. how do you vectorize any custom function using numpy function and annotation
19. how do you vectorize any custom function using numba library and its annotation
20. how to measure time around how much time a function execution takes for example?

We will be using table3 data set for following questions
21. write a function that takes a value of rate and parses out total population and set the population to new column

We will use tips data set for following questions
22. how to use pandas and seaborn functions to plot different types of graphs
23. train a model using linear regression
24. how to use dummy encoding or one hot encoding using pandas function
